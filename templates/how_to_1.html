        <p><strong>It's not rocket science</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Adding semantic value to your news is not rocket science. It doesn’t even require serious plumbing in the depths of your database.
        </p>
        <p>You can do it very simply by changing a few fields in your HTML templates.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Basic Level Mark-Up</strong> (<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom</a>)
        </p>
        <p>At its most basic level – the ‘dip-your-toe-in’ added value – you can do this by marking up your content using the hAtom microformat. 
        </p>
        <p>hAtom provides semantic information for basic aspects of a news story – such as who wrote it, who it was written for and when it was published. Information that should already be machine-readable but in most cases isn’t. Integrating hAtom will make key elements of your content machine readable, but won’t distinguish your content specifically as news or identify usage rights.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Value Added News Mark-Up</strong> (hnews)
        </p>
        <p>To distinguish your content as news, and embed information about usage rights, a site should supp additional levels of semantic standards. For this we recommend hNews. hNews is an extension to the hAtom microformat developed in partnership with AP and released into the public domain.
